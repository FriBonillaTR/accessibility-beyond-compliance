        - Ask who’s being excluded – We often get asked, “Is this accessible?”
        and there’s really only one answer for that, “For who?”. Questioning who
        is being excluded is key to unlocking different perspectives. - Don’t
        stop learning - We have a ton of resources available, all available from
        our Digital Accessibility Center of Excellence on Atrium - Be wrong and
        grow – I make them every day, even people with lived experience with
        disabilities make mistakes or assumptions based on their own unique
        experience. Why? Because they’re people. If you’re too afraid to start
        nothing will change, everyone makes mistakes it’s how we grow. Take that
        first step.
