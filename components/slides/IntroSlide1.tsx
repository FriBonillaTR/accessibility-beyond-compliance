        Let’s consider a scenario: An elderly user, perhaps a retired judge or
        senior legal consultant, is trying to access one of our platforms. The
        interface meets all accessibility standards, but the font is small, the
        navigation is dense, and the usage is overly technical. Technically,
        it’s accessible. Practically, it’s frustrating. Now imagine this same
        user also speaks English as a second language. The experience becomes
        even more challenging, not because of a lack of effort, but because the
        design didn’t account for the full context of the user. Accessibility
        isn’t just about disability; it’s about designing for the full range of
        human experience. Our users bring with them layers of identity: age,
        language, gender, neurodiversity, cultural background, and these layers
        shape how they interact with our products. When we treat accessibility
        as a mindset, we begin to design with empathy, not just for compliance,
        but for care. And that mindset helps us build tools that are not only
        usable but empowering.
