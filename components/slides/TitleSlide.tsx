        Accessibility is already part of our process. Across our legal and tax
        products, we’ve built strong foundations—thanks to the work of our
        Accessibility Specialists, UX Engineers, and product teams. Today, we’re
        not revisiting the basics. We’re here to reflect on how we evolve our
        mindset and improve our process. Because even in highly specialized
        fields, our users are not one-dimensional. They’re professionals, yes,
        but also people navigating diverse realities. A tax advisor working
        across jurisdictions in a second language. A legal researcher with ADHD
        reviewing dense case law. A judge accessing briefs on a mobile device in
        traffic. These examples show us that accessibility isn’t just about
        standards, it’s about people. This talk is structured around three
        ideas: The Limits of Compliance: how following the rules doesn’t always
        mean we’re including people. Accessibility Meets Identity: how ability
        interacts with language, age, gender, and lived experience. Designing
        with Intention: how we shift from checklists to conscious, inclusive
        design decisions. This is a lookout, a moment to pause and ask: Are we
        designing for standards, or are we designing for the full reality of our
        users?
