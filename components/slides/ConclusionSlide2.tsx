        • Act Fast, Learn Fast: Progress not perfection - We don’t wait for
        perfect solutions—we iterate, test, and improve. Accessibility thrives
        in environments where learning is continuous, and feedback is embraced.
        • Challenge (Y)our Thinking: Who’s not in the room? - Inclusion demands
        that we question assumptions. Who are we leaving out? What biases are
        baked into our defaults? Accessibility pushes us to think
        differently—and better. • Obsess Over Our Customers: You are not your
        user. Designing with empathy means truly understanding and serving all
        of them. • Stronger Together: Accessibility is not the job of one team.
        When designers, developers, researchers, and product leads collaborate,
        we build better, more inclusive experiences. • Compete to Win: Ethical
        and strategic - Inclusive design isn’t just ethical—it’s strategic.
        Products that work for more people build loyalty, reduce remediation
        costs, and stand out in the market.
